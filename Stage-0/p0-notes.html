<h1>Content</h1>
<p>This lesson has two parts.</p>
<p><b>Part 1</p></b>
<p>In Part 1 you will develop enough technological empathy to understand what
  happens when you open (or create) a web page. Specifically, you'll gain:
Basic understanding of how the internet works.</p>
<p>Understanding of how users, computers, servers, http, and the internet all
  fit together.</p>
<p><b>Part 2</p></b>
<p>In Part 2 you will use HTML tags to create a simple HTML document that a
  browser can display as a web page.</p>
<p>Note that the next video is Steve introducing the entire course. You won't
  actually take the whole course in this Nanodegree program, but it's still
  worth learning what his course covers in case you decide you want to take the
  whole thing later.</p>

<h1>Thinking Like a Programmer</h1>

<p>A large goal of this Nanodegree is to give you practice thinking like a computer
programmer. Longtime programmers will often talk about how the programming
thought process has helped them in other areas of their life, but what does it
mean to "think like a programmer?" In this Nanodegree we will focus on five
specific ways of thinking that all programmers have to use all the time. We will
come back to these ideas repeatedly throughout the Nanodegree.</p>
<p><b>1. Procedural Thinking</b></p>
<p><em>Procedural thinking</em> involves <em>creating perfectly clear and unambiguous
instructions</em> for a computer to follow.</p>
<p>It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards, but getting a
computer to do that requires more thought. But once you've learned to think this
way you'll find that computers can do it much faster.</p>
<p><b>2. Abstract Thinking</b></p>
<p><em>Abstract thinking</em> means <em>finding similarity</em>, or as programmers would say,
generality amongst seemingly different things. </p>
<p>In this Nanodegree you will visit hundreds of Udacity web pages. It would be
impractical for a programmer to specifically program each of these pages
individually. The Udacity programmers used the power of what's called
abstraction to avoid unnecessary repetition of work.</p>
<p><b>3. Systems Thinking</b></p>
<p><em>Systems thinking</em> happens when you <em>break a big problem down into smaller pieces.</em>
Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program
will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem
and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it. If this is
unclear now, don't worry! You'll understand what this means much more clearly by
the end of the Nanodegree.</p>
<p><b>4. Technological Empathy</b></p>
<p>"<em>Technological empathy</em>" comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is
the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good
and bad at doing.</p>
<p>A computer is a tool, as are the programs we use and the programming languages
used to write them. It's almost impossible to program anything substantial
without a basic understanding of how these tools work.</p>
<p><b>5. Debugging</b></p>
<p><em>Debugging</em> is a systematic process of <em>relentlessly identifying the cause of a
computer program that doesn't work</em>. </p>
<p>When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake (also known as a
"bug") somewhere in the computer code. Since these mistakes are an unavoidable
part of programming, every good programmer has a system for fixing them and that
system usually looks something like this: </p>
<p>1.Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?)</p>
<p>2.Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)</p>
<p>3.Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)</p>
<p>4.Fix the problem</p>

<b>HTML and Tags</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em></p>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.</p>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.</p>
